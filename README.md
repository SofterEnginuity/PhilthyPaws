## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

More template fun! This site was made with my dog in mind. I would love to see a one-stop shop to pamper my pup! Also, who doesnt love a good pun - there are plenty in this one!

## Lessons Learned:

This one threw some curve balls at me when inserting my photos, I had to navigate through restrictive structures that limited how I was able implement and modify certain features and functionalities.
